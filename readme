Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create the Python script etl_project_gdp.py that accomplishes all the tasks you've mentioned.

1. Data Extraction
First, you'll need to extract the GDP data from the given URL. For this, you can use the requests library to download the webpage and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information.

2. Data Transformation
You'll need to transform the GDP data into "Billion USD" if it's provided in "Million USD." This involves dividing the values by 1,000.

3. Data Loading
You'll store the data in both a CSV file (Countries_by_GDP.csv) and a SQLite database (World_Economies.db). The pandas library can be used to create the CSV file, and sqlite3 for the database operations.

4. Running a Query
Finally, you'll execute a SQL query on the database to display countries with a GDP greater than 100 billion USD.

5. Logging
Throughout the script, you'll log each step with a timestamp in the etl_project_log.txt file.
